type: module
description: Migrate Drupal 7 Publications to Drupal 8
core: 8.x
package: Custom
# Our module depends on Migrate Plus because we'll use migration configuration
# entities. We also have a soft-dependency on Migrate Tools since without it we
# can't actually execute our migrations. But, having it enabled isn't a
# requirement so we don't necessarily need to list it here.
dependencies:
  - migrate_plus
